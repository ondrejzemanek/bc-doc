= IFTTT - If This Then That


== What is IFTTT?

*IFTTT* or “If This Then That” is a free web-based service that aggregates many other web apps into one place and can then perform actions given a certain set of criteria.

IFTTT is made to create *recipes* -- If something happens in one service *This* (*Trigger*), Then something should Happen in another service *That* (*Action*).
This whole chain is called *Applet*.

As a trigger service can be used *Maker* service that allows you to communicate with IFTTT through a *Web request* (*POST*).

The Maker service is useful for BigClown Hub integration.


== How to create a new Applet?

. The first step is to create your account on https://ifttt.com/[*IFTTT*].
. After login, click on your username in the top-right corner and open menu, then Select *"New Applet"*.
. This opens a page with "if *this* Then That". First select the trigger service *"this"*.
. From the list of all services, select trigger *Maker* service.
. Connect to the Maker channel and select option *"Receive a web request"*.
. Fill the *event name* and select *"Create Trigger"*.
. The last step brings you back to the page "Then if this *That*".
  But this time set *action „that“*.
. Choose action service that you want to affected by trigger service and follow the service instructions.
. Finally click on *"Create action"* and you are done!


== How to send data to IFTTT using Maker service?

When you create an account on the *Maker* service, maker generates a unique key that allows you to communicate with IFTTT.

This key can be found in the Maker settings.

For information about Maker service follow these instructions:

. Search for *Maker* service. (On the top bar of IFTTT page, click on *"Search"*.)
. On the "About" page click on *"Settings"* (in the top-right corner).
. Last step brings you to settings page for Maker service.
  Here you will need *URL* that contains the unique Maker key.
. Click on *URL*, that will bring you to how-to page.

According to these instructions, you can build a final address where you can send data.

The *final address* will look like this:

 https://maker.ifttt.com/trigger/{event}/with/key/{key}

* `{event}` - Step 6 in the instructions "How to create an new applet?".
* `{key}` – your Maker unique key

Data is sent using the *POST* method in the *JSON* format:

[source, json]
{"value1": "your_first_value", "value2": "your_second_value", "value3": "your_third_value"}

You can send up to *3 values* in one request.


== Example

A simple *Python 3* example for BigClown Hub has been provided to test IFTTT service.
You can find it in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/bigclownlabs/bc-ifttt[*BigClown IFTTT Service Integration Example*].


=== Usage

. Set your `event` name and Maker `key` in *_url* variable in *IFTTTWorker* class.
. If you want, you can modify constants for temperature thresholds and hysteresis:
+
[source, python]
TEMPERATURE_TRESHOLD_HIGH = {top threshold temperature}
TEMPERATURE_TRESHOLD_LOW = {bottom threshold temperature}
TEMPERATURE_ALARM_HYSTERESIS = {temperature hysteresis}

. Run it.
